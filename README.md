## Introduction
This is a KOF 02UM bot in a very early stage of development based on the XV bot by [@Lantors](https://github.com/dens0ne) to which a lot of credit goes to. The  information is pulled from the current latest [Framedata sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lzpQMoGAboJezLT9WRd3O-vlNDNRlgF_47ShtBGZ3G4).

## Usage
The bot has a `/frames` slash command which accept 2 arguments:
- the `character` which is a case insensitive string (e.g. Kyo, Iori)
- the `move` which is a case insensitive string of the motion or name (e.g. Crouch C, Close A)

## Notes
Hitbox images will be added slowly, starting with normal moves.

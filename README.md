## Introduction
This is a KOF XIII bot in a very early stage of development made by [@Franck_Frost](https://twitter.com/FranckFrost), and based on the XV bot by [@Lantors](https://github.com/dens0ne) to which a lot of credit goes to. The  information is pulled from the current latest [Framedata sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lzpQMoGAboJezLT9WRd3O-vlNDNRlgF_47ShtBGZ3G4).
